# Vanilla & Denoising Autoencoders

This repository contains Python code for implementing Vanilla and Denoising Autoencoders and their applications on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

The aim of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of Autoencoders, an unsupervised learning technique, for learning compressed representations of data. We will explore two types of Autoencoders:

1. **Vanilla Autoencoders:** A basic form of Autoencoders that learns to compress and reconstruct data.

2. **Denoising Autoencoders:** An extension of Vanilla Autoencoders, which are trained to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs.

## Dataset

We use the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The dataset contains grayscale images of various fashion items such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyritez3/DL-Autoenocoder.git

cd DL-Autoenocoder
```
2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Results

The code provides visualizations of the original and reconstructed images for both Vanilla and Denoising Autoencoders. Additionally, it displays the reconstruction loss for each type of Autoencoder.
